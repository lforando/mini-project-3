```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(macleish)
library(leaflet)
library(raster)
library(rgeos)
library(mapview)
```

```{r}
names(macleish_layers)
```

Create a new variable named macleish_trails which only includes the data about the trails and arranges them by difficulty. Color was renamed to 'difficulty' for easier understanding and explanation. 
```{r}
names(macleish_layers)
macleish_trails <- macleish_layers[["trails"]]
macleish_trails <- macleish_trails %>% 
  rename(difficulty = color) %>%
  arrange(difficulty)

macleish_boundary <- macleish_layers[["boundary"]]
macleish_ladnmarks <- macleish_layers[["landmarks"]]

macleish_trails
```

```{r}
the_crs <- crs(macleish_trails, asText = TRUE)
boundary_crs <- st_transofrm(, crs = the_crs)


```





```{r}
#leaflet() %>%
  #addTiles() %>%
  #addPolylines(data = pluck(macleish_layers, "contours_30ft"), weight = 2)

```

```{r}
 #trail_plot <- leaflet() %>% 
  #setView(lng = -72.68513, lat = 42.44177, zoom = 13)
#trail_plot %>% addTiles()

#ggplot() +
  #geom_point(aes(x = geometry))
