```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(macleish)
library(leaflet)
library(raster)
library(rgeos)
library(mapview)
```

```{r}
names(macleish_layers)
```

Create a new variable named macleish_trails which only includes the data about the trails and arranges them by difficulty. Color was renamed to 'difficulty' for easier understanding and explanation. 
```{r}
names(macleish_layers)
macleish_trails <- macleish_layers[["trails"]] 

macleish_trails <- macleish_trails %>% 
  rename(difficulty = color) %>%
  arrange(difficulty)

macleish_trails
```

```{r}
 trail_plot <- leaflet() %>% 
  setView(lng = -72.68513, lat = 42.44177, zoom = 13)
trail_plot %>% addTiles()
```
