library(macleish)
```


Create a new variable named macleish_trails which only includes the data about the trails and arranges them by difficulty. Color was renamed to 'difficulty' for easier understanding and explanation. 
```{r}
names(macleish_layers)
macleish_trails <- macleish_layers[["trails"]]

macleish_trails <- macleish_trails %>% 
  rename(difficulty = color) %>%
  arrange(difficulty)

macleish_trails
```

```{r}
#ggplot(data = macleish_trails) +
  #geom_sf(aes(fill = difficulty)) 
   #labs(title = )
```
