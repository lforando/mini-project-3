```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(macleish)
library(leaflet)
library(raster)
library(rgeos)
library(mapview)
```

```{r}
names(macleish_layers)
```

Create a new variable named macleish_trails which only includes the data about the trails and arranges them by difficulty. Color was renamed to 'difficulty' for easier understanding and explanation. 
```{r}
names(macleish_layers)
macleish_trails <- macleish_layers[["trails"]]
macleish_trails <- macleish_trails %>% 
  rename(difficulty = color) %>%
  arrange(difficulty)

macleish_boundary <- macleish_layers[["boundary"]]
macleish_ladnmarks <- macleish_layers[["landmarks"]]

macleish_trails
```


```{r}
leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addPolylines(data = pluck(macleish_layers, "contours_30ft"), 
               weight = 2, col = "blue") %>%
  addPolylines(data = pluck(macleish_layers, "trails"), col = "red") %>%
  addPolylines(data = pluck(macleish_layers, "boundary"), col = "blue") %>%
  addMarkers(data = pluck(macleish_layers, "landmarks"))

```

```{r}
#need to create 3 variables of difficulty
#(adding difficulty column to macleish layers so you can map aesthetic)
```
